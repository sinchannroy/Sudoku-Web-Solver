# Sudoku-Web-Solver

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution. The objective is to fill a square grid of size n with numbers between 1 to n to ensure a solution can be reached. Every time a new question is generated, this web solver solves the puzzle as per the rules and regulations.
